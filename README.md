			"devices": [ "lights", "meters", "sensors", "scenes", "thermostats" ],

```
"localip": "1.2.3.4",
```
Where 1.2.3.4 matches with the local IP address of your Zipabox or Zipatile.

## Devices

One can prevent the scenes or the lights devices to be processed by removing them from the 'devices' array in the configuration.

## Filters

To filter specific items to be exposed throught Homebridge its Zipato name can be added in the 'filters' array in the configuration.

## String replace

Renaming exposed items can be done using the 'replace' key/value store in the configuration. It will do simple string replacements, so also partial strings will be replaced.
